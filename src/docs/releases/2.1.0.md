## Change Logs

### External User Authentication Feature

A new feature, **External User Authentication**, has been added. This feature was separated from the existing **Users** feature to provide better dependency management and offer an option to disable external authentication by default.

After upgrading the site, a fast-forward option allows you to enable this feature automatically when needed. As a result, the following settings have been relocated to new classes:

- The properties `UseScriptToSyncRoles` and `SyncRolesScript` have been moved from `LoginSettings` to a new class, `ExternalLoginSettings`.
- The property `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined` has been moved from `LoginSettings` to `ExternalLoginSettings`.

Additionally, the following properties have been moved from `RegistrationSettings` to `ExternalRegistrationSettings`:

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoPassword`.
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoUsername`.
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoEmail`.
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.UseScriptToGenerateUsername`.
- `GenerateUsernameScript` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.GenerateUsernameScript`.

- Moreover, the following properties have been moved from `LoginSettings` to `ExternalLoginSettings`:

- `UseScriptToSyncRoles` is now `ExternalLoginSettings.UseScriptToSyncProperties`.
- `SyncRolesScript` is now `ExternalLoginSettings.SyncPropertiesScript`.

!!! note
    When configuring `LoginSettings` or `RegistrationSettings` in a recipe, ensure that the recipe's properties are updated to reflect the new settings classes.

### New 'Azure Communication SMS' feature

Simply enable it then navigate to the admin dashboard > `Configurations` >> `Settings` >> `SMS` to configure the provider.
