## Change Logs

### External Authentication Feature

We've introduced a new feature called **External Authentication**. This feature has been separated from the existing **Users** feature to improve dependency management and to provide an option to disable external authentication by default. As a result, the **User Registration** feature no longer needs to be enabled unless you specifically want to allow site registration.

This feature is only available on-demand and cannot be manually enabled or disabled. It is automatically enabled when a feature requiring external authentication is activated.

We included a fast-forward migration to enable this feature automatically if previously needed. No action is needed from site administrators.

The following settings have been relocated to new classes as part of this update:

- The properties `UseScriptToSyncRoles` and `SyncRolesScript` have been moved from `LoginSettings` to the new `ExternalLoginSettings` class.
- The property `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined` has also been moved from `LoginSettings` to `ExternalLoginSettings`.

In addition, several properties have been moved from `RegistrationSettings` to a new `ExternalRegistrationSettings` class:

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoPassword`.
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoUsername`.
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoEmail`.
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.UseScriptToGenerateUsername`.
- `GenerateUsernameScript` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.GenerateUsernameScript`.

Moreover, a new property, `DisableNewRegistrations`, has been added to `ExternalRegistrationSettings`, allowing you to prevent new external users from registering on the site. This property will be set by default if you are currently using the **NoRegistration** value for the obsolete `UsersCanRegister` property.

Also, note the following updates in `ExternalLoginSettings`:

- `UseScriptToSyncRoles` has been renamed to `ExternalLoginSettings.UseScriptToSyncProperties`.
- `SyncRolesScript` has been renamed to `ExternalLoginSettings.SyncPropertiesScript`.

!!! note
    When updating recipes to configure `LoginSettings` or `RegistrationSettings`, ensure that the settings reflect the new class structure.

### User Registration Feature

The **User Registration** feature is no longer required if you only want to enable external authentication. 

The following properties of `RegistrationSettings` are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `UsersCanRegister`
- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`

Previously, the `UsersCanRegister` property controlled which types of registration were allowed. With this update, this property is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To enable site registration now, simply activate the **User Registration** feature.

### New **Azure Communication Services SMS** Feature

A new feature was added to allow you to send SMS messages using Azure Communication Services (ACS). Simply enable it then navigate to the admin dashboard > `Configurations` >> `Settings` >> `SMS` to configure the provider. For more information you can refer to the [docs](../reference/modules/Sms.Azure/README.md).

### **Azure Communication Services Email** Feature Update

The feature formerly known as **Azure Email Provider** has been renamed to **Azure Communication Services Email** to clarify that it uses ACS, and to use the same naming pattern as the ACS SMS feature (see above).

Additionally, the configuration provider key for the default provider has changed from `OrchardCore_Email_Azure` to `OrchardCore_Email_AzureCommunicationServices`. While the old key (`OrchardCore_Email_Azure`) will continue to bind for backward compatibility, it is scheduled for removal in the next major release. To ensure future compatibility, it is highly recommended to update your configuration to use the new key.
