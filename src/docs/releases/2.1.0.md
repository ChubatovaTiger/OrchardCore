Release date: Not yet released

## Change Logs

### New **Azure Communication Services (SMS)** Feature

A new feature was added to allow you to send SMS messages using Azure Communication Services (ACS). Simply enable it then navigate to the admin dashboard > `Configurations` >> `Settings` >> `SMS` to configure the provider. For more information you can refer to the [docs](../reference/modules/Sms.Azure/README.md).

### **Azure Communication Services (Email)** Feature Update

The feature formerly known as **Azure Email Provider** has been renamed to **Azure Communication Services (Email)**.

Additionally, the configuration provider key for the default provider has changed from `OrchardCore_Email_Azure` to `OrchardCore_Email_AzureCommunicationServices`. While the old key (`OrchardCore_Email_Azure`) will continue to bind for backward compatibility, it is scheduled for removal in the next major release. To ensure future compatibility, it is highly recommended to update your configuration to use the new key.
