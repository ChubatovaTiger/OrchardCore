# Orchard Core 1.9.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Media Indexing

Previously, `.PDF` file where auto indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you needed to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you needed to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

!!! warning
    For backward compatibility, you should use `yessql.db` as the database name in the `OrchardCore_Data_Sqlite` configuration. For more info read the [Data (`OrchardCore.Data`) documentation](../reference/core/Data/README.md).

### SMS Module

In the past, we utilized the injection of `ISmsProvider`for sending SMS messages. However, in this release, it is now necessary to inject `ISmsService` instead.

Additionally, `Twilio` provider is no longer enabled by default. If you want to use Twilio SMS provider, you must enable `OrchardCore.Sms.Twilio` feature.

### Azure AI Search Module

Introducing a new "Azure AI Search" module, designed to empower you in the administration of Azure AI Search indices. When enabled with the "Search" module, it facilitates frontend full-text search capabilities through Azure AI Search. For more info read the [Azure AI Search](../reference/modules/AzureAISearch/README.md) docs.

### Deployment Module

Added new extensions to make registering custom deployment step easier

- services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep>();
- services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep, TDisplayDriver>();
- services.AddDeploymentWithoutSource<TStep, TDisplayDriver>();

### Data Access

Prior this release, the default SQLite database for newly created tenants was `yessql.db`. Now, the `orchardcore.db` file is utilized instead. However, you have the flexibility to configure the database name beforehand in the ShellSettings of the tenants by including the `DatabaseName` property.
