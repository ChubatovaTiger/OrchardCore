# Orchard Core 1.9.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Media Indexing

Previously, `.PDF` file where auto indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you needed to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you needed to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

### Data Access

Previousle, `yessql.db` file was used as a default SQLite database for newly created tenant. Now `OrchardCore.db` has been used instead, but you could configure the database name using `SqliteOptions.Database`.

!!! note
    For backward compatibility you could use `yessql.db` as database name in the `OrchardCore_Data_Sqlite` configuration. For more info read the [Data (OrchardCore.Data)](../reference/core/Data/README.md) docs.
