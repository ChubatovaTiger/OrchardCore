# Orchard Core 1.6.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Features and Recipes

The `OrchardCore.Features` module is no longer always enabled. It used to depend on `OrchardCore.Recipes` feature and is no longer the case. If you find yourself using recipes services like `IRecipeMigrator` in your module, then be sure to add dependency to `OrchardCore.Recipes.Core` feature in your module's Manifest' file to ensures that the recipe services are available before trying to use them.

If your are using setup recipes and want to enable `Features`, be sure to explicitly enable `OrchardCore.Feature`
