# Orchard Core 1.6.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Features and Recipes

`OrchardCore.Features` is no longer auto enabled by `OrchardCore.Recipes` as it doesn't depend on it anymore. If you find yourself using recipes services like `IRecipeMigrator` in your module, be sure to add a dependency on `OrchardCore.Recipes.Core` feature in your module's Manifest file to ensures that the recipe services are available before using them.

If your are using setup recipes and want to enable `Features`, be sure to explicitly enable `OrchardCore.Feature` feature.
