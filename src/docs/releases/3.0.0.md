# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Elasticsearch Module

#### Dropping Support for the NEST Library

Previously, the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library was used to interact with the Elasticsearch service. However, since NEST has been deprecated, we have transitioned to its successor, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). As part of this migration, the following interfaces and classes have been removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticsearchQueryService`
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

- To enhance consistency, all classes and interfaces are now prefixed with `Elasticsearch` rather than `Elastic` or `ElasticSearch`, with the exception of settings, to minimize further breaking changes.

Additionally, the class `ElasticsearchQueryService` has been marked as internal.
