## Breaking Changes

### Elasticsearch Module

#### Drop Support for NEST Library

Previously, the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library was used to interact with the Elasticsearch service. Since NEST has been deprecated, we have migrated to its replacement, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). During this migration, the following interfaces and classes were removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticsearchQueryService`
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

Additionally, the class `ElasticSearchQueryService` has been marked as internal.
