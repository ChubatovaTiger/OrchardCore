# Orchard Core 1.7.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

The size of the database identity columns is now configurable, this concerns the `Id` column of all tables, and the `DocumentId` column of all
index tables. So, the following fields (of entities and map indexes) related to these columns have been updated from an `int` to a `long` type.


!!! note
    If you have custom entities and map indexes having the same fields, it is recommended to update them accordingly.

- `ContentItem.Id`.
- `DataMigrationRecord.Id`.
- `IndexingTask.Id`.
- `User.Id`.
- `DeploymentPlan.Id`.
- `Workflow.Id`.
- `WorkflowType.Id`.
- `WorkflowEntry.Id`.
- `WorkflowTypeEntry.Id`.
- `OpenIdApplication.Id`.
- `OpenIdAuthorization.Id`.
- `OpenIdScope.Id`.
- `OpenIdToken.Id`.
- `ContentItemIndex.DocumentId`.
- `AutoroutePartIndex.DocumentId`.
- `AutorouteEntry.DocumentId`.
- `LocalizedContentItemIndex.DocumentId`.
- `LocalizationEntry.DocumentId`.
- `UserIndex.DocumentId`.
- `DeploymentPlanIndex.DocumentId`.
- `WorkflowIndex.DocumentId`.
- `WorkflowTypeIndex.DocumentId`.

The `YesSql.ISession.GetAsync<T>(int id, ...)` has already been updated to `GetAsync<T>(long id, ...)`, this was not a breaking change as an `int`
is implcitly converted to a `long` but it is now recommended to pass a `long` id parameter.

The `YesSql.ISession.GetAsync<T>(int[] ids, ...)` has already been updated to `GetAsync(long[] ids, ...)`, for backward compatibility an extension
method accepting an `int[]` array has been created but it is recommended to use the method of the updated `ISession` interface.

So, the following interfaces and implementations methods using these `YesSql` methods directly or not and having the same kind of parameters have been updated.
For backward compatibility extensions still accepting a collection of `int` ids have been created but it is recommended to use the methods of the updated interfaces.

- `ISession.GetAsync<T>(long id, string collection = null)`, recommended extension method.
- `ISession.GetAsync<T>(long[] ids, string collection = null)`, recommended interface method.
- `ISession.GetAsync<T>(int[] ids, string collection = null)`, not recommended extension method.
- `IContentManagerSession.RecallVersionId(long id, out ContentItem item)`.
- `IIndexingTaskManager.GetIndexingTasksAsync(long afterTaskId, int count)`.
- `IWorkflowStore.GetAsync(long id)`.
- `IWorkflowStore.GetAsync(IEnumerable<long> ids)`, recommended.
- `IWorkflowStore.GetAsync(IEnumerable<int> ids)`, not recommended extension method.
- `IWorkflowTypeStore.GetAsync(long id)`.
- `IWorkflowTypeStore.GetAsync(IEnumerable<long> ids)`, recommended.
- `IWorkflowTypeStore.GetAsync(IEnumerable<int> ids)`, not recommended extension method.
- `long LuceneIndexingState.GetLastTaskId(string indexName)` now returns a `long`.
- `Task<long> ElasticIndexManager.GetLastTaskId(string indexName)` now returns a `long`.

!!! note
    If you have custom implementations using the above methods, it is recommended to update them accordingly, and to change the signature of methods having
    an `int` or a collection of `int` parameter so that they accept a `long` or a collection of `long` parameter.

## Change Logs

### `OrchardCore.AdminDashboard` Module

A sample widget is no longer auto created when the `OrchardCore.AdminDashboard` feature is enabled. If you like to see a sample widget, you may do so by executing the "Admin Dashboard Widget Sample" recipe by using the admin menu and navigate to **Configuration** >> **Recipes**

### `OrchardCore.Users` Module

Added support for complete two-factor authentication out of the box. [Click here](../reference/modules/Users/README.md) for more info.

### `OrchardCore.Seo` Module

The `Seo` feature now provides `robots.txt` out of the box when the filesystem does not contain one. New settings are available at **Configuration** >> **Settings** >> **SEO** to allow you to configure what should be included into the `robots.txt` file.

!!! note
    If the [Sitemaps](../modules/Sitemaps) feature is enabled, all sitemap indexes and sitemaps are added to the `robots.txt` by default. 

### `OrchardCore.Contents` Module

#### List Content Types by Stereotype

The Contents admin UI now provides a way to manage content items of content types that share the same Stereotype.

For example, lets say we want list all content items of a content types that use `Test` stereotype. To do that, add an admin menu item that directs the user to `/Admin/Contents/ContentItems?stereotype=Test`. Adding `stereotype=Test` to the URL will render the UI using any content type that has `Test` as it's stereotype.

#### Full-Text Search for Admin UI.

Additional options have been introduced to enable control over the behavior of the full-text search in the administration user interface for content items.

For instance, consider a content type called `Product.` Currently, when a user performs a search, the default behavior is to check if the search terms are present in the `DisplayText` column of the `ContentItemIndex` for the content item. However, what if a user wants to search for a product using its serial number, which is not part of the `DisplayText` field?

With the newly added options, we can now allow searching for products based on either the display text or the serial number. To modify the default behavior, two steps need to be taken:

 1. Implement `IContentsAdminListFilterProvider` interface by defining a custom lookup logic. For example

 ```C#
public class ProductContentsAdminListFilterProvider : IContentsAdminListFilterProvider
{
    public void Build(QueryEngineBuilder<ContentItem> builder)
    {
        builder
            .WithNamedTerm("producttext", builder => builder
                .ManyCondition(
                    (val, query) => query.Any(
                        (q) => q.With<ContentItemIndex>(i => i.DisplayText != null && i.DisplayText.Contains(val)),
                        (q) => q.With<ProductIndex>(i => i.SerialNumber != null && i.SerialNumber.Contains(val))
                    ),
                    (val, query) => query.All(
                        (q) => q.With<ContentItemIndex>(i => i.DisplayText == null || i.DisplayText.NotContains(val)),
                        (q) => q.With<ProductIndex>(i => i.SerialNumber == null || i.SerialNumber.NotContains(val))
                    )
                )
            );
    }
}
```
 2. Register the custom default term name as a search option by adding it to the `ContentsAdminListFilterOptions.` For example

 ```C#
services.Configure<ContentsAdminListFilterOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DefaultTermNames.Add("Product", "producttext");
});
 ```

Now, when a user searches for a product's serial number in the administration UI, we will utilize the `producttext` filter instead of the default `text` filter to perform the search.

The `UseExactMatch` option in the `ContentsAdminListFilterOptions` class modifies the default search behavior by enclosing searched terms within quotation marks, creating an exact match search by default, this unless if the search text explicitly uses 'OR' or 'AND' operators.

### `OrchardCore.Facebook` Module

A new feature called `Meta Pixel` was added to allow you to easily enable Meta Pixel tracking into your website

Due to Facebook's recent rebranding, all of the Facebook features have been renamed to Meta. This only concerns UI labels and documentation, but technical identifiers remain, so you shouldn't expect anything breaking. Here is a list of the naming changes:

| Previous Name | New Name |
| --- | --- |
| `Facebook` | `Meta Core Components` |
| `Facebook Login` | `Meta Login` |
| `Facebook Social Plugins Widgets` | `Meta Social Plugins Widgets` |

### `OrchardCore.Microsoft.Authentication` Module

Due to Microsoft's recent rebranding, Azure AD has been renamed to Microsoft Entra ID. This only concerns UI labels and documentation, but technical identifiers remain, so you shouldn't expect anything breaking.
