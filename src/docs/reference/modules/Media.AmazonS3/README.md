# Amazon S3 Media Storage (`OrchardCore.Media.AmazonS3`)

The Amazon Media Storage feature enables support for storing assets in Amazon S3 Bucket.

The feature replaces the default App_Data file-based media store with an Amazon Media Storage Provider.

Media is still served by the Orchard Core website, and the Media Cache module takes responsibility for fetching media, on the fly, from the Amazon S3 Bucket.

This allows the Amazon Media Storage feature to support image resizing on the fly through integration with `ImageSharp.Web`.

The URL generated by the AssetUrl helpers points to the Orchard Core website.

## Configuration

The following configuration values are used by default and can be customized:

```json
{
   "OrchardCore": {
       "OrchardCore_Media_Amazon_S3": {
           // Your AWS S3 Bucket name
           "BucketName": "",
           // This section needed only if Orchard will be hosted not in the AWS Cloud
           // You can obtain all that information in the IAM Management Console
            "Credentials": {
              "SecretKey": "",
              "AccessKeyId": "",
              "RegionEndpoint": ""
           },
           // Optionally, set to a path to store media in a subdirectory inside your container.
           "BasePath": "/media",
           // If you have aws cli installed and configured you may just specify profile name
           "ProfileName": ""
       }
  }
}
```

Refer also to the [Configuration Section](../../core/Configuration/README.md),
and the [Media Section](../Media/README.md) for other Media related configuration settings.

There are two hosting options: inside and outside AWS Cloud.
In case you are hosting Orchard Core inside AWS (EC2, EKS, etc.) you need to configure only `BucketName` and you may delete or comment out the other sections.

In case you are hosting Orchard Core outside of AWS, you should fill the `Credentials` section or if you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your server you may specify only configured profile name (`default` if a profile name was not chosen during AWS CLI configuration).

You can find region endpoints in the [Official AWS S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html), see Region column. For example for the Frankfurt region you should use `eu-central-1` 

## AWS S3 Bucket Configuration

By default, AWS 3S Bucket has limitations for newly uploaded files. If you want media files to be available from the outside of AWS, you should set up your bucket permissions.

The simplest way of doing it is to add a policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
After this policy will be added to your bucket permissions all newly added files will have Read permission and will be available from the outside of the Amazon Cloud.

## Templating Configuration

Optionally you may use Liquid templating to further configure Amazon Media Storage, perhaps creating a bucket per tenant,
or a single bucket with a base path per tenant.

The `ShellSettings` property is made available to the Liquid template.
The `BucketName` property and the `BasePath` property are the only templatable properties.

!!! note
    When templating the `BucketName`  using  `{{ ShellSettings.Name }}`, the tenant's name will be automatically lowercased, however, you must also make sure the `BucketName` conforms to other Amazon S3 naming conventions as set out in Amazon's documentation.

### Configuring a bucket per tenant

```json
{
    "OrchardCore": {
        "OrchardCore_Media_Amazon_S3": {
            "BucketName": "{{ ShellSettings.Name }}-media",
            "Credentials": {
                "SecretKey": "",
                "AccessKeyId": "",
                "RegionEndpoint": ""
            },
            "BasePath": "/media",
            "ProfileName": ""
        }
    }
}
```

### Configuring a single bucket, with a base folder per tenant

```json
{
    "OrchardCore": {
        "OrchardCore_Media_Amazon_S3": {
            "BucketName": "",
            "Credentials": {
                "SecretKey": "",
                "AccessKeyId": "",
                "RegionEndpoint": ""
            },
            "BasePath": "{{ ShellSettings.Name }}/Media",
            "ProfileName": ""
        }
    }
}
```

## Media Cache

The Media Cache feature will automatically be enabled when Amazon Media Storage is enabled.

The Media Cache feature will cache files stored in Amazon S3 Storage, to support image resizing.

The Media Cache feature allows Purging of the Media Cache files stored locally.

You might choose to use the Purging feature if you are fronting the media assets with a CDN.
After allowing a long enough period of time for the CDN to have fetched a significant number of Media assets, both resized, and full size, from the Media Cache you might consider purging the cache.

However please bear in mind that your CDN provider will likely have multiple Points of Presence worldwide, and each of these will maintain their own cache, so while a local CDN PoP might have the asset another PoP may not, until it is requested. At this stage the Media Cache will, if necessary, refetch the asset from Amazon S3 Storage, on the fly, and provide it to the CDN PoP.

CDN providers also clear their caches at pre-determined times of their own devising, so while CDNs are a valuable caching and performance asset, it is important that they are always be able to re-fetch the source file, as and when required, which the Media Cache Module will automatically handle.

!!! note
    The Media Feature is designed to support one storage provider at a time, whether that is
    local File Storage (the default), Azure Blob Storage, or Amazon S3 Storage.
