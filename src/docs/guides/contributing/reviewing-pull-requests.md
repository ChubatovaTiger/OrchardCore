# Reviewing pull requests

Giving feedback on pull requests, i.e. reviewing them, is a very important contribution too. While it's mostly core contributors doing reviews, don't shy away from a review if you aren't one! Anybody can review a pull requests, just core contributors can merge them.

!!! tip
    Reviews also show up as green blobs under your GitHub profile, did you know that? :)

## Tips for reviewers

- For general guidelines on reviewing code, see the [Dojo Library](https://orcharddojo.net/orchard-resources/CoreLibrary/DevelopmentGuidelines/CodeReview). Stack Overflow also has [some good principles](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/).
- [Here's a list](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+reviewed-by%3A%40me) of open PRs reviewed by you. Maybe check them because perhaps it's time to ping the authors since maybe they forgot to follow up? Or maybe you forgot to merge a PR? 
- Add the "dontmerge" label on PRs that are ready for review, approved by you and/or others, but you asked more people for feedback before it can be merged.
- Add the "needs triage" label on PRs that you think should be checked by others during the weekly triage meeting too. Explain in a comment why do you deem this is necessary.
- Be sure to actually merge PRs that don't need a second opinion. This is especially important for external contributors who can't merge their own PRs. Keeping PRs open will make them collect merge conflicts and make the contributor demotivated.
- Be especially patient and encouraging with first-time contributors. This is indicated by such a flag on the PR.
